## Welcome
This project provides an [ASP.NET MVC 5] (http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc5) front-end for a 
[CKAN] (http://wiki.ckan.net/Main_Page) repository.  This project provides
a fully functioning web-based data catalog based on a group in a shared CKAN respository.

In addition, this project provides a C# wrapper for the [CKAN API Version 2][1] for developers
that want to develop .NET applications against any CKAN repository.

### About
This project was forked from the [Open Colorado] (http://www.opencolorado.org) .NET Wrapper project.
