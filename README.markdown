#DRAFT

## Welcome
This project provides an [ASP.NET MVC 3] (http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3) front-end for a 
[CKAN] (http://wiki.ckan.net/Main_Page) repository.  This project provides
a fully functioning web-based data catalog that is specific to a group in a shared CKAN respository.

### About
This project was created in partnership with [Open Colorado] (http://www.opencolorado.org) and 
Colorado Smart Communities.  

This .NET implementation was created for communities that want to leverage the common CKAN 
repository (http://colorado.ckan.net) while hosting a local data catalog front-end on their organization's
Windows/.NET platform.  For organizations that prefer, there is also 
a [PHP front-end] (https://github.com/opencolorado/PHP-Wrapper-for-CKAN-API)  available.
