## Welcome
This project provides an [ASP.NET MVC 3] (http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3) front-end for a 
[CKAN] (http://wiki.ckan.net/Main_Page) repository.  This project provides
a fully functioning web-based data catalog that is specific to a group in a shared CKAN respository.

This .NET implementation was created for communities that want to leverage the common CKAN 
repository (http://colorado.ckan.net) while hosting a local data catalog front-end on their organization's
